Features:

Add Task: Users should be able to add a new task to their todo list by entering a task description into a text field and clicking an "Add" button.

View Tasks: Users should be able to view their existing tasks listed in a scrollable list format. Each task should be displayed with a checkbox indicating whether it's completed or not.

Delete Task: Users should be able to delete a task from their todo list by clicking on a delete button associated with each task.

User Interface:

The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface with the following components:

A text field for entering new tasks.
An "Add" button to add the entered task to the todo list.
A scrollable list to display existing tasks, each with a checkbox and a delete button.
Technical Requirements:

The app should be developed for Android devices using Kotlin programming language.
Utilize Jetpack Compose for building the user interface.
Use state management techniques such as ViewModel to manage the todo list data.
Implement appropriate error handling to handle edge cases such as empty task descriptions.
Submission:

You are required to submit the source code of the todo list app along with a brief documentation outlining the features, user interface, and technical implementation details.
